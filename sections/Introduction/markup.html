    <p><strong>Smart table</strong> is an <a href="#">Angularjs</a> module to easily display data in a table with a set
        of built in functionalities such filetering,
        sorting, etc. While developing this module I made sure to focus on this particular points:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>lightweight</strong>: smart-table is less than 13kb minified and has <strong>no
            dependencies</strong> other than Angular itself
        </li>
        <li><strong>robust</strong>: smart-table is widely tested which makes the module really stable</li>
        <li><strong>useful</strong>: smart-table will allow you to have a table on which you will be able to perform
            common operations with <strong>simple</strong> configuration
        </li>
        <li><strong>developer friendly</strong>: the design of the module has been thought carefully and it is really
            easy to get into the source code to modify/customise the module to best fit your needs.
            You will find for example:
            <ul>
                <li>on the <a href="https://github.com/lorenzofox3/Smart-Table/tree/server-sample">different branches</a> of the project some custom implementation to turn
                    smart-table into a server driven table while changing less than 10 lines
                </li>

                <li>on <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/xsJs8m?p=preview">plunker</a>(here made by Jiri Kavulak) some custom implementation with richer
                    functionalities
                </li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Although smart-table is by far the best table module for angular :D, there are other table modules in the
        angular ecosystem you might be interested in. The approach and philosophy are different and maybe more appropriate to your way of building web application. Among the most popular:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/ng-grid/">ng-grid</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://esvit.github.io/ng-table/#!/">ng-table</a></li>
    </ul>
